# 🎵 Soundbite Backend

Audio Streaming service where you can upload and share your audios.

Obviusly this proyect is linked with the [SoundBite-Frontend✨](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/soundbite-frontend) repo.

This project was created for educational purposes and uses Python, FastAPI, MongoDB and a cloud storage service.

During this project, I learned and practiced:
* FastAPI (obviously the main purpose why I'm doing this) 🚀
* How to manage StreamingResponses. 🎧
* How to manage MongoDB with pymongo. 🍃
* JWT implementation. 🔑
* And more... 💪
